iCORN2 has been extensively updated, mainly to achieve parallization and avoid errors related to memory usage or sequences above 300 Mb. Some of the most relevant changes are listed below:
* Kept only scripts relevant for ILRA (i.e., removed LSF scripts, icorn2.cutHomopolymerTracks.pl, icorn2.startSNP.sh, icorn2.stats2csv.pl, etc)
* iCORN2 now automatically tries to avoid processing single sequences (i.e. contigs or chromosomes) larger than an user-specified value (by default, 300 Mb, which is the upper limit for SNP-o-matic)
* icorn2.serial_bowtie2.sh
  - Rewrote usage page. Added new arguments, defined their default values and exported them
    + The size of the blocks of sequences that would be processed simultaneously using GNU's parallel (number of cores automatically distributed)
    + Whether to activate the low memory mode, which would reduce the number of cores at some steps and deactivate the simultaneous processing (so contigs would be processed sequentially, as originally)
  - Updated versions of picard and GATK are now requiring a temporal directory, which is automatically created and removed afterwards
  - SNP-o-matic is the only step within iCORN2 and ILRA not accepting fastq.gz files. Thus, iCORN2 is first decompressing the reads (will be removed afterwards)
  - icorn2.mapper.sh replaces icorn2.bowtie2.sh
  - A new script, icorn2.snpcall.correction.sh, gathers the previous SNP calling and correction steps. It is executed simultaneously on the splitted parts (sequentially and with less cores if low memory mode is activated). It also contains the ReorderSam execution
  - samtools faidx, picards's CreateSequenceDictionary and picard's ReorderSam are executed on the splitted sequences simultaneously (ReorderSam sequentially and with less cores if low memory mode is activated)
  - The splitted parts are finally automatically merged, and results are identical to the old and slower processing.
* icorn2.mapper.sh
  - iCORN2 is now only using Bowtie2 in --very-sensitive mode
  - Rewrote usage. The basename of the Illumina short reads is now provided as an argument to map in bowtie2 and exported to be incorporated in the header of the alignment file
  - All the downstream processing of the sam file (i.e., reheading, converting to bam, sorting) is now done in a one-line pipe from bowtie2. Samtools is also now multithreaded and much faster, and capable of converting to bam, sorting and indexing in the same command
  - Updated MarkDuplicatesSpark (multithreaded) replaces the previous MarkDuplicates.jar
* icorn2.snpcall.correction.sh
  - The modified SNP caller (GenomeAnalysisTK.jar) wasn't using the multithreaded option (-nt) for RealignerTargetCreator and UnifiedGenotyper. It is now.
  - The JAVA version used is the outdated 1.7, which is required in the new installation instructions. Absolute paths are used so no messing around with different versions
  - ReorderSam 
  - Allocated RAM for JAVA is now provided through an argument and automatically redistributed to avoid excessive use of memory by the parallel execution of ReorderSam
