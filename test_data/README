######### ILRA arguments:
ILRA.sh -a <Assembly> -o <Results directory> -c <Long reads corrected reads> -n <Name of results> -r <Reference genome for ABACAS2> -I <Root name of Illumina short reads> -t <Number of cores to use> -s <First sequence name to circularize> -S <Second sequence name to circularize> -i <Number of iterations for iCORN2> -f <Size threshold for discarding contigs> -R <Insert size range for Illumina short reads> -T <NCBI taxonomy id to extract> -g <GFF reference genes annotation file> -L <Long reads sequencing technology> -e <Telomeric sequence left> -E <Telomeric sequence right> -m <Execution mode>
### Parameters are not positional. If you did not provide any required parameter, the pipeline will exit or use default values if possible (check the log after execution or the 'Arguments / Variables' section in the pipeline ILRA.sh)

######### Required software:
### Many scripts (bash, perl...) within the ILRA folder are used, and you may need to manually change the interpreter in the corresponding shebang (first line #!) statements so everything works in your system. You may also need to make scripts executable (chmod) and to execute "source" or "export" so that the PATH variable and others are available for all scripts.
### Many software and dependencies are also required and are going to be automatically checked. The pipeline will exit if any required software is not found in the variable PATH of your system, which you likely need to change accordingly. Check the log after execution or the 'Checking the installed software and databases' section in the pipeline ILRA.sh.

######### Databases for decontamination:
### If not executing the light mode that skips decontamination, the subfolder 'databases' is going to be automatically created and must be populated manually by the user before executing ILRA. ILRA is going to provide instructions in the log after an execution.

######### Suggested execution for ILRA: (replace XXX by a number of cores to use and use the appropriate paths to the files of interest)
